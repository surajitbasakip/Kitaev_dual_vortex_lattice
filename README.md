### Kitaev's vortex-full Honeycomb Model with anti-vortices

This notebook explores the eigenvalues of the Kitaev honeycomb model. 

## The following steps are carried out:
- Calculation of eigenvalues for the fortex full model.
- Addition of two anti-vortices and study of their impact.
- Examination of the energy splitting in the lowest energy states with respect to the Next Nearest Neighbour hopping parameter K.
  
## Key Steps:

-Theory: The Kitaev model is an exactly solvable model on a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice. In this notebook we consider the original Kitaev's model and fill it with \pi/2 flux.
-Analysis: The energy splitting with respect to the nearest neighbour hopping parameter gives us an indication of the topological nature of the system.
